<bubble sort>
expensive sort -> you can exchange two values for the langth,
when you finished sort, the last one shoud be the biggest number,
you can reduce 1 length, and exchange again....

IF ALREADY SORTED -> once

<selection sort>
seek the smallest data and set it the first element

<insertion sort>
first element is 1, add 1 elemtns, and compare with last elements value, and if the result is
between 1, b you can insert this value to. check from last element.
affter adding 1 new element, the rest data is unsorted and inserted elements are sorted.

less than bubble sort
IF ALREADY SORTED:ONCE(n)
